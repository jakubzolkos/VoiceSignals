Steps to make:
1. Load files
2. Check if they are already converted to .wav extension if they are not --> convert them
3. Make a .csv file
4. Feature extraction
5. Save features to a csv file
6. Data preprocessing
7. Model approach
8. Check the scores, save results
9. Save the results and find different solutions of data preprocessing (so back to step 6.)

Program will contain classes responsible for different steps 
First class --> steps: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9.
Second class --> steps: 4.
Third class --> steps: 6.
Fourth class --> steps: 7, 8.
