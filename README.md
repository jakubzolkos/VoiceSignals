<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

According to the data collected by the NHTSA, in 2019 in the United States, 10142 people died as a result of alcohol-impaired driving. A considerably high number of drinking-related road accidents prompts many public authorities to seek legal solutions, such as fines or imprisonment, that would discourage people from driving under the influence. However, those methods frequently yield unsatisfactory results. Our idea is to make a voice-detecting system embedded in a vehicle that would prevent the driver from activating the vehicle's engine if their voice points towards prior alcohol consumption.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The program uses several third-party libraries to perform preprocessing and data classification. They can all be installed si
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

Open the terminal and change the directory to where you would like download the project.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jakubzolkos/sobriety-voice-detection.git
   ```
2. Install prerequisites
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the program with the classification model inside sobriety_detection folder
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```
