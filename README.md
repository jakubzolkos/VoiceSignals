**Spectral centroid** --> It indicates where the center of mass of the spectrum is located. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_centroid

**Spectral bandwidth** --> shows how our program works. - The spectral bandwidth is defined as the width of the band of light at one-half the peak maximum (or full width at half maximum [FWHM]) and is represented by the two vertical red lines and Î»SB on the wavelength axis. - https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/audio-data-analysis-deep-learning-python-part-1.html

***

**Spectral rolloff** --> shows how our program works. - Spectral rolloff indicates the roll off frequency for each frame in signal. - https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/audio-data-analysis-deep-learning-python-part-1.html

***

**MFCCGs** --> shows how our program works. - Small set of features which concisely describe the overall shape of a spectral envelope.

***

**Chroma feature** --> shows how our program works. - It provides a strong way to describe a similarity measure between voice pieces.
